       (* THIS IS A HACK. Read below for dragons.
        * 
        * Assumptions:
        * - Deadlock checking is active.
        * - TLC is performing breadth-first search (BFS). This will be completely
        *   broken with a depth-first queue, and I didn't even think about
        *   simulation mode. In fact, I have seen depth-first queue accept
        *   invalid outputs with this definition, so do not trust anything
        *   you see if this definition is combined with non BFS evaluation.
        * - Because this expression comes syntactically after all useful
        *   next-states disjunctions, it will be evaluated after they have
        *   had a chance to add items to the state queue.
        *   !THIS IS THE HACK PART! -> it relies on a (true as of writing)
        *   assumption regarding how TLC evaluates next-state relations.
        * - Therefore, if we get here and our state queue is empty, we have
        *   exhausted all other possible ways to move beyond our next-state.
        * 
        * Behavior:
        * (a) If we are at end of trace, allow a self-loop, because that is
        *     our desired outcome and it's fine to stop here.
        * (b) If we are out of options but there are states on the queue,
        *     allow a self loop to make TLC keep searching.
        * 
        * If we have not exhausted the trace and the queue is empty, we should
        * force TLC to report a deadlock at exactly this state. Do this
        * by disabling this action and therefore not adding a self loop.
        * Because of how BFS works, our current trace is a pseudo-randomly
        * selected longest prefix TLC could find where all predecessor states
        * could be linearized. If there was more than one way to do that, TLC
        * will be forced to report the last one that comes off its state queue.
        * Careful use of the debugger should allow exploring other
        * interpretations (breakpoint on the trace length to see them).
