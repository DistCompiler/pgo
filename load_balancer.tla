----------------------------- MODULE load_balancer -----------------------------
(***************************************************************************)
(* Specifies a simple load balancer.                                       *)
(***************************************************************************)

\* Extends some built-in TLA+ modules
EXTENDS Naturals, Sequences, TLC

\* The `TCPChannel` mapping macro used in this specification is parameterized
\* by a `BUFFER_SIZE` constant. This value controls the number of messages being
\* held in a buffer by each process. Processes trying to send a message to another
\* process with a full buffer wil "block" (not be scheduled by TLC).
CONSTANT BUFFER_SIZE

\* Define a constant identifier for the load balancer.
CONSTANT LoadBalancerId

\* The number of servers and clients in the model checking setup.
CONSTANTS NUM_SERVERS, NUM_CLIENTS

\* TLC should assume that both numbers are greater than zero (i.e., we always
\* have at least one server and one client). Note, however, that increasing
\* these numbers makes the number of states to be checked by TLC to grow
\* exponentially.
ASSUME NUM_SERVERS > 0 /\ NUM_CLIENTS > 0

\* GET_PAGE is a label attached to messages sent from the clients to
\* the load balancer.
CONSTANTS GET_PAGE

\* Represents a file that can be returned by the server
CONSTANT WEB_PAGE

(***************************************************************************
--mpcal LoadBalancer {
  define {
    \* total nodes in the system:
    \*    number of clients + number of servers + the load balancer
    NUM_NODES == NUM_CLIENTS + NUM_SERVERS + 1
  }

  \* The TCPChannel mapping macro models a communication channel
  \* between two processes using TCP-like semantics. In particular:
  \*
  \* - reading from the channel "blocks" unless there is a message
  \*   ready to be read.
  \* - message delivery is reliable and ordered (i.e., FIFO).
  mapping macro TCPChannel {
      read {
          await Len($variable) > 0;
          with (msg = Head($variable)) {
              $variable := Tail($variable);
              yield msg;
          };
      }

      write {
          await Len($variable) < BUFFER_SIZE;
          yield Append($variable, $value);
      }
  }

  \* Mapping macros keep implementation-specific behavior that we don't
  \* want to model check outside of our archetype definitions.
  \* In the case of this load balancer, how a server retrieves a web page
  \* is orthogonal to the correctness of the properties we are interested
  \* to check with this specification.
  \*
  \* This mapping macro abstracts the process of reading a web page by
  \* always returning the `WEB_PAGE` constant when the variable is read.
  \*
  \* Since "writing" to this mapping is meaningless, the attempting to write
  \* to a variable mapped with WebPage will result in a model checking
  \* error (see `assert(FALSE)` in the write definition).
  mapping macro WebPages {
     read {
         yield WEB_PAGE;
     }

     write {
         assert(FALSE);
         yield $value;
     }
  }

  \* ALoadBalancer is the archetype that defines the behavior of
  \* the load balancer process. The `mailboxes` parameter represents
  \* connections to all nodes in the system.
  archetype ALoadBalancer(ref mailboxes)

  \* Local variables of this archetype:
  variables
             \* Holds messages received by the load balancer (sent
             \* by clients)
             msg,

             \* identifier attached to every message sent to servers by
             \* the load balancer.
             next = 0;
  {
      main:
        while (TRUE) {

            \* waits for a message to be received. Upon receipt, the `assert`
            \* call ensures that the message is of type `GET_PAGE`, the only
            \* type of message supported in this simple specification.
            \*
            \* Every message received by the load balancer is expected to
            \* be a record of the following type.
            \*
            \*    [message_type : Int, client_id : Int, path: Interface{}]
            \*
            \* Note that tuples are 1-indexed.
            rcvMsg:
              msg := mailboxes[LoadBalancerId];
              print << "Received req", msg.path >>;
              assert(msg.message_type = GET_PAGE);

            \* the load balancer needs to forward the client request to the
            \* server, who will process the request and send a web page back to
            \* the client.
            \*
            \* The message sent to the server is a tuple in the format:
            \*
            \*     [message_id : Int, client_id : Int, path: Interface{}]
            \*
            \* We send the client ID here so that the server can directly
            \* reply to a client, bypassing the load balancer. This is usually
            \* not what happens in practice, but the model is simple
            \* enough for our (illustrative) purposes.
            sendServer:
              next := (next % NUM_SERVERS) + 1;
              print << "Send req", msg.path, "to server", next >>;
              mailboxes[next] := [message_id |-> next, client_id |-> msg.client_id, path |-> msg.path];
        }
  }

  \* AServer is the archetype that defines the behavior of the servers
  \* in our system. The two parameters it recieves are:
  \*
  \* - mailboxes: contains connections to every node in the system
  \* - file_system: abstraction of a real file system. In practice,
  \*                this is implementation specific and irrelevant for
  \*                the properties we want to check in this specification
  archetype AServer(ref mailboxes, file_system)

  \* Local variables
  variable
            \* temporary buffer to hold incoming messages
            msg;
  {
      serverLoop:
        while (TRUE) {

            \* waits for an incoming message. Note that the only process
            \* that sends messages to the server is the load balancer process
            \* (defined according to the ALoadBalancer archetype) and the
            \* message has the type [message_id : Int, client_id : Int]
            rcvReq:
              msg := mailboxes[self];

          sendPage:
            \* sends a web page (read from `file_system`) back to the requester
            \* i.e., the client.
            print << "Serving", msg.path, "to client", msg.client_id >>;
            mailboxes[msg.client_id] := file_system[msg.path];
        }
  }

  \* Client processes are given integer identifiers starting from NUM_SERVERS+1.
  \* Keep in mind that this "range" notation in PlusCal defines a set, and is
  \* _inclusive_ (i.e., NUM_SERVERS+NUM_CLIENTS+1 is part of the set).
  \*
  \* The parameters received by a client are:
  \*
  \* - mailboxes: contains connections to every node in the system
  \* - instream: a stream of inputs to the client
  \* - outstream: an output stream, where the client sends the messages it receives
  \*              from servers.
  archetype AClient(ref mailboxes, instream, ref outstream)

            req, resp;
  {
      clientLoop:
        while (TRUE) {

            \* First, the client makes a request to the load balancer.
            \* The format of the message is a tuple:
            \*
            \*     [message_type : Int, client_id : Int, path : Interface{}].
            \*
            \* If you check the ALoadBalancer definition, this is the message format
            \* expected there.
            \*
            \* Remember that `self` is an implicitly defined, immutable variable that
            \* contains the process identifier of the "running" process.
            clientRequest:
              req := [message_type |-> GET_PAGE, client_id |-> self, path |-> instream];
              mailboxes[LoadBalancerId] := req;

            \* Clients then wait for the response to the previously sent request.
            \* Since there is only one type of web page in this simple specification
            \* (defined by the WEB_PAGE constant), we assert here that the message
            \* received indeed is equal our expected web page.
            clientReceive:
              resp := mailboxes[self];
              outstream := resp;
        }

(* INVARIANTS *)


\* This is an _invariant_ of our specification: in other words,
\* we expect the BuffersOk predicate to always be true in every step of execution
BufferOk(node) == Len(network[node]) >= 0 /\ Len(network[node]) <= BUFFER_SIZE
BuffersOk == \A node \in DOMAIN network : BufferOk(node)


(* PROPERTIES *)

\* This is a property we would like to check about our specification.
\* Properties are defined using _temporal logic_. In this specific example,
\* we want to make sure that every client that requests a web page (i.e., are
\* in the 'clientRequest' label) eventually receive a response (i.e., are
\* in the 'clientReceive' label). In order to specify this property, we have to
\* write the formula as if the client enters 'clientReceive' label, it will
\* eventually successfully receive a response and then go back to issuing
\* another request in the 'clientRequest' label.
ReceivesPage(client) == pc[client] = "clientReceive" ~> pc[client] = "clientRequest"
ClientsOk == \A client \in (NUM_SERVERS+1)..(NUM_SERVERS+NUM_CLIENTS) : ReceivesPage(client)
