We expect that it can also be used to specify and check concurrent algorithms and protocols for software systems. This describes our experience at DEC/Compaq using TLA+ and the TLC model checker on several systems, mainly cache-coherence protocols. It is shorter than, and more up-to-date than [128]. }, publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.}, url = {https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/specifying-and-verifying-systems-with-tla/}, address = {Saint-Emilion, France}, pages = {45–48}, journal = {}, volume = {}, chapter = {}, isbn = {}, }
